# Steps on complete Working of git right from installation

After installing:
- Open cmd.exe **or** git cmd interface
- Make new folder as **Workstation for your work** and other commits/ **Open Project directory that you are working on.**
- Go to **current_working_directory** using the command **'cd', 'cd..', 'dir'** that is the folder you are working on.
- **git init** : This will create a ".git" hidden folder
- **git status** : Shows the files (_It will appear in red if files are available_)
- **git add file_name** : Adds the file named "**file_name**" to git (_On rechecking of "git status", the entered file will turn green_)
- **git commit -m "Comment_the_changes_that_you_made"** : Use to add comment to remember the changes (_Do not forget to use **write comment in between double quotation, don't miss " " double_quotation_.**)
- **touch file_name.extension** : This command is used to create a new file (Eg: **touch index.html** _This will make a new **html_file** named **index_**)

# Some common commands in "git"

- **git add *.extension** To add all files with the entered extension e.g,**.txt extention** will add all text files.
- **git add .** To add all files that aren't included or added yet.
